I am currently a researcher at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), specializing in **AI4Health**. My research interests include **Graph Learning**, **Medical Image Analysis**, and **Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks**.

I am passionate about leveraging artificial intelligence to solve complex problems in healthcare and biomedical fields.

# Research Interests
*   **AI for Healthcare**: Applying deep learning techniques to medical imaging and clinical data analysis.
*   **Graph Neural Networks**: Developing novel GNN architectures for structured data, particularly in social and biological networks.
*   **Medical Image Segmentation**: Focus on brain tumor segmentation and lesion localization using advanced neural network models (e.g., GMLN-BTS, SAMba-UNet).

# News
*   **[Jan 2025]** Our paper "An Attention-Based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network for Social Account Classification" was presented at [ICBDSC 2025](http://icbdsc.org/) in Singapore.
*   **[2025]** New preprint "Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation" is now available on arXiv.

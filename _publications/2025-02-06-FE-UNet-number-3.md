excerpt: 'We proposes FE-UNet, a novel segmentation model featuring a Wavelet Adaptive Spectrum Fusion (WASF) method and a Perception Frequency Block (PFB) inspired by biological vision, which effectively balances cross-frequency features to achieve state-of-the-art performance in challenging cross-domain tasks like deep-sea and surgical image segmentation.'

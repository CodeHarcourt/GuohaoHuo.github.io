excerpt: 'We proposes EdgeIMLocSys, featuring the lightweight GMLN-BTS network with a Modality-Aware Adaptive Encoder, a Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Module, and a Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module, achieving high-accuracy, parameter-efficient brain tumor segmentation (85.1% Dice on BraTS2017 with only 4.58M parameters) and enabling continuous adaptation via clinician feedback for robustness across MRI scanners.'
